# Introduction

This repository contains the work for predicting effective strategies for 2,3-Butanediol
over production in C. autoethanogenum. First a genome scale metabolic model is used
to predict first, second, and third order strategies for Butanediol over production.
Then this predictions are mapped to the existing kinetic model, Greene et al., to
find the verify the results with and independent method. "Final_Script.m" includes
the whole pipeline, and it calls different functions, including the kinetic model.  \

To check for some obvious interventions, and see why they do not appear in OptForce results, please open Interv_Check MATLAB live script file.
