# Report on intervention strategies

The overall pipeline is as follows:

* Using Optforce, top 100 theoretical interventions (First, Second, and Third order interventions) were found. A significant amount of these interventions are not intuitive, if not wrong.

* To have a cross validation tool, an available kinetic model was used. Kinetic models are
ideal tools for examining these interventions since they are directly dealing with enzyme expression levels. Luckily, there was already a kinetic model available for C. autoethanogenum.

* We used the following experimental condition for both metaclau, and the kinetic model:

| Reference  | Addition experimental factor | qH2 (mmol/gCDW/h) |qCO2 (mmol/gCDW/h)|
| :---------: | :-----------------------------: | :----------: | :-----: |
| Valgepea 2018|	high-H2 CO (LBC  i.e. 0.5 gCDW/)	15% CO; 45% H2; 40% Ar|	-20.042 | -33.042|	1.083	9.042	0	0.04
